<li><a name="General">Outline of unsolicited messaging function

<blockquote>
<dl>
<p>In the Unsolicited messaging function, the Message can be voluntarily notified from CNC to the personal computer according to the instruction of the ladder program or the NC program Note1).  So, in the PC application, the state of CNC can be observed without the polling process.  Arbitrary data of PMC or Macro variables Note1) can be transmitted as the Message.  In the PC application, the polling process to inquire the state of CNC regularly becomes unnecessary by using this function.

<p>The unsolicited messaging issues the window message to the PC application internally and notifies the Message.  So, Visual C++ is necessary for making the application.

<p>Note1) NC program and Macro variable can be used only by 30i/31i/32i/35i, 0i-D and PMi-A.
<br/>
<p>This function is supported at the following ethernet function.
<li type="square">16i/18i/21i, 0i-B/C/D, Power Mate i (Not supported at Ethernet board/Embedded Ethernet)

<li>PMC data and Message transfer mechanism for the unsolicited messaging
<blockquote>

   <p>PMC "R" or "E" address data is used to the control for transmitting the Message from CNC.
      When the unsolicited messaging function is used, it is necessary to make the ladder program which controls the following signals.

<p><img src="unmsgbit.gif"></p>

<ul>
	<dl compact>
        <dt>REQ : <dd>When the Message is transmitted, the ladder program turns on this signal.
                      It is necessary to set a necessary message before this signal is turned on.
        <dt>COM : <dd>When the Message transmission is begun from CNC, this signal is turned on.
                      This signal is turned on by communication board.
                      And communication board turns off this signal immediately before "RES" is turned on after "RES_CODE" is set.
        <dt>RES : <dd>This signal is turned on immediately after the Message transmission is completed and the PC completes the Message
                      reception.  This signal is turned on by communication board.  Please turn off the "REQ" signal after processing
                      according to RES_CODE by ladder program.
                      After "REQ" signal is turned off, communication board clears RES_CODE and turns off this signal.

        <dt>RES_CODE : <dd>The Message reception result is set according to "RES".
                           The reception result is set by communication board.
                           After the reception result is processed by ladder program, "REQ" must be turned off by ladder program.
                           When "REQ" signal was turned off, CNC clears this area.

<li><a name="Make">Making method of application which uses the unsolicited messaging function
<blockquote>

  <ol type=i>
  <li>Set the parameter for the unsolicited messaging to CNC.

      <p>The parameter for the unsolicited messaging function is set to CNC SRAM area using cnc_wrunsolicprm().
         The parameter can be read by cnc_rdunsolicprm(), if necessary.

  <li>Notify the completion of preparing the unsolicited messaging to CNC.

      <p>The completion of preparing the unsolicited messaging is notified to CNC using cnc_unsolicstart().
         After this call, CNC part can send the Message.

  <li>Add the function to process the unsolicited messaging.

<code><pre>
     // Example of ON_MESSAGE
     #define WM_MYMESSAGE (WM_APP + 1)
     BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP( CMyWnd, CMyParentWndClass )
         //{{AFX_MSG_MAP( CMyWnd
         ON_MESSAGE( WM_MYMESSAGE, OnMyMessage )
         //}}AFX_MSG_MAP
     END_MESSAGE_MAP( )

     LRESULT CMyWnd::OnMyMessage(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
     {
         LRESULT result;
         // Process the Message from CNC using cnc_rdunsolicmsg(), etc.
         return result;
     }
</pre></code>

   <p>The arguments of the OnMyMessage() function are as follows.
   <dl>
   <dt>wParam
          <dd> = -3 : The socket communication error occurred.
          <dd> = -2 : The unsolicited message server has stopped.
          <dd> = -1 : The CNC power was turned off.
          <dd> =  0 : The Message from CNC arrived. (normal process)
          <dd> =  1 : The CNC power was turned on.
   <dt>lParam
          <dd> =  "Handle for the Message data reading" : in case of wParam = 0 
                  This value can be used as the argument for cnc_rdunsolicmsg().
          <dd> =  0 : Other than wParam = 0
   </dl>

   <p>Note)
   <ul>
   <dl>
   <dt>In case of "wParam = -3" : 
       <dd>The "Handle for the Message data reading" on the CNC side becomes invalid, so call cnc_unsolicstart() again.
           When the problem is not solved, investigate CNC power supply, Ethernet cable and I/F board. 

   <dt>In case of "wParam = -2" :
       <dd>The window message cannot be received at the application. 
           So, both the restart of the application and the Unsolicited messaging server is necessary. 

   <dt>In case of "wparam = -1" :
       <dd>The application should wait for the wParam to become "1".
           And it is necessary to execute the acquisition of the library handle again.
   </dl>
   </ul>

   <p>And the OnMyMessage() function can set "RES_CODE" of the PMC data for
     unsolicited messaging control by setting the return value in "result" when
     wParam=0.
     The value of "result" which can be set by the application is as follows.
         <dd>result = 0x00, 0x10..0x1F, 0x30..0x3F

         <p>

  <li>Read the unsolicited messaging data.

      <p>The transmitted message data at above OnMyMessage() routine is read by using cnc_rdunsolicmsg().

  <li>Notify the termination of receiving the unsolicited messaging to CNC.

      <p>The termination of receiving the unsolicited message from CNC is notified by cnc_unsolicstop() when the PC application finishes.
  </ol>

   <p>In Windows Vista, the CNC unsolicited message can not be received when the application for message receiving is executed as "Run as administrator".
